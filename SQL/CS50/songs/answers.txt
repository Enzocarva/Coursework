I would describe their moods as slightly serious and energetic. Energetic because their average energy and danceability were relatively high (above 50%). Serious, because their valence was below 50%.

This may not be representative at all of the listener because you can't assume someboy's "mood" just by looking at their most listened songs and artists. I honestly find this method to be good for calculating the aura as far that goes, I can't think of a much better way.
