sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because since it has a worst case of O(n^2) and best case of omega(n), and the worst case is when it is reversed and best when it is sorted, which corresponds with the data gathered.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because it has a theta(n log n), which means all cases will have a similar time to execute, which corresponds with the data gathered.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Because it has a theta(n^2), meaning all the cases will have a similar time, which corresponds with the data gathered.
