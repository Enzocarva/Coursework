Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I hypothized that with every tenfold increase in simulations, the time increase would become larger and larger disproportionally. So I was right about that, but wrong about how long it would take for 1 Million simulations, which i had predicted 2 seconds (and it was 7.4).

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would say that the predictions were stbilized after somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 simulations. So personally, I would run it at 10,000 if I were charged per second.
